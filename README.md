# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA and Prophet

This repository focuses on the analysis and forecasting of time series data using two popular methods: **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** and **Prophet**. These models are widely used for understanding trends, seasonality, and making future predictions.

---

## Overview

Time series analysis is the process of examining time-ordered data points to extract meaningful patterns and forecast future values. This project demonstrates the use of **ARIMA** and **Prophet** for analyzing time series data, highlighting their strengths and differences.

## What is ARIMA?

ARIMA is a statistical method used for time series forecasting. It combines three components:

- **AR (AutoRegressive)**: Uses the dependency between current and previous observations.
- **I (Integrated)**: Makes the series stationary by differencing the data.
- **MA (Moving Average)**: Accounts for the dependency between an observation and a residual error.

### Advantages:
- Suitable for stationary time series.
- Offers precise control over model parameters.

### Limitations:
- Requires the data to be stationary.
- Parameter tuning (p, d, q) can be complex.

## What is Prophet?

Prophet is a robust, open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It is designed to handle time series with:

- Seasonal effects.
- Missing data.
- Outliers.

### Advantages:
- Easy to use and interpret.
- Handles seasonality and holidays effectively.
- Works well with non-stationary data.

### Limitations:
- Less flexible compared to ARIMA for fine-tuned statistical analysis.

## Key Features

### Data Exploration:
- Visualizing trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns in time series data.
- Handling missing values and outliers.

### ARIMA Modeling:
- Identifying stationarity and differencing the data if needed.
- Selecting the optimal parameters \(p\), \(d\), and \(q\).
- Evaluating the model performance using metrics like AIC, BIC, and RMSE.

### Prophet Modeling:
- Fitting the model with automatic handling of seasonality and holidays.
- Visualizing trends, seasonal components, and forecasts.
- Incorporating external regressors (if applicable).

### Model Evaluation:
- Comparing forecast accuracy between ARIMA and Prophet.
- Analyzing residuals to check model assumptions.

## Prerequisites

To run the analysis, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly**: For visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: For building ARIMA models.
- **pmdarima**: For automatic ARIMA parameter selection.
- **Prophet**: For flexible time series forecasting.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:
- Load and clean the time series data.
- Handle missing values and detect outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Plot time series to identify trends and seasonality.
- Perform stationarity tests (ADF or KPSS).

### Model Development:
- Build ARIMA and Prophet models.
- Tune parameters to optimize performance.

### Forecasting:
- Generate future predictions using both models.
- Visualize and compare forecasts.

### Evaluation:
- Compare the models using evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
- Analyze residuals for patterns or anomalies.
